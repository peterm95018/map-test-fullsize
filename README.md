# map-test-fullsize
A responsive Bootstrap template for 100% map.

This little project is an effort to build up a template so that we can get a 100% map or static content area with a collapsible sidebar. Modeled on some of the look and feel for University of Colorado Boulder, what I expect to do is integrate these views of a nodejs app.

Here's a screen shot of what we're going for <img src="Screen Shot 2016-07-07 at 4.23.49 PM.png">

The template is based on a bootply template I found at http://www.bootply.com/9Y6V5ALkXY. 

I've made some mods including moving the zoomControl to 'topright', and started adjusting the media queries. The final design will probably have the collapsed button toggle the sidebar instead of the navbar.
